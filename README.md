# AI_Prompt_Repository

This small Blazor Server app is a project I've been working on and adding too as a learning project. I wanted to take a small idea and build on it while I learned Blazor. I did that with this project and built a card based display with various little features. It's not designed for use, but can be built upon and modified.
